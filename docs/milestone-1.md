### Application Idea

The main idea of the application is an online tetris player where you can play with other people simultaneously. This will be accomplished by using the socket.io Node.js library. This means the application will be working with the data of board states for each user, along with their user info such as username, password, high score, etc. Data for each running server or "room" for the game also has to be created and stored whenever a new room is created.
